# Customer Churn Prediction in Subscription Services

## Overview  
Customer churn is a critical challenge for subscription-based businesses such as Spotify and Netflix, where even small increases in churn can lead to significant revenue loss. This project applies data analytics and machine learning techniques to predict customer churn and uncover behavioral patterns that drive customer retention.

The goal of this project is to enable businesses to proactively identify high-risk customers and design targeted retention strategies using data-driven insights.

---

## Problem Statement  
Subscription platforms struggle to detect early signs of customer disengagement, especially among high-value users. Traditional reactive approaches result in lost revenue and reduced customer lifetime value.

This project addresses the problem by building predictive models that identify churn risk based on customer demographics, subscription details, engagement behavior, and service interactions.

---

## Objectives  
- Predict customer churn using machine learning models  
- Identify key behavioral and demographic factors influencing churn  
- Translate analytical insights into actionable business recommendations  
- Support proactive retention and revenue optimization strategies  

---

## Dataset Description  
The dataset consists of customer-level information commonly found in subscription-based services:

- Demographics: age, gender  
- Subscription details: plan type, multi-screen access  
- Engagement metrics: minutes consumed, listening or viewing frequency  
- Device usage: smartphone, computer, smart speaker  
- Customer support interactions  

The analysis focuses on identifying churn behavior among high-value customers.

## Methodology  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Cleaned and prepared large-scale customer data  
- Handled missing values and encoded categorical features  
- Scaled numerical variables for modeling  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Analyzed churn trends across age groups, devices, and subscription types  
- Studied engagement intensity and customer support patterns  
- Identified early indicators of disengagement  

### 3. Modeling  
- Logistic Regression for interpretability  
- Random Forest for capturing non-linear relationships  
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC  

### 4. Business Interpretation  
- Translated churn predictions into customer retention strategies  
- Linked churn drivers to pricing, engagement, and product decisions

## Key Insights  
- Customers aged 20–35 showed the highest engagement and retention potential  
- Premium and multi-screen subscribers exhibited significantly lower churn  
- Smart speaker users showed higher churn due to passive usage patterns  
- Reduced engagement minutes and frequent customer support interactions were strong churn indicators  
- Approximately 70% of churned users returned within 45 days, highlighting strong win-back opportunities

## Business Impact  
- Enabled proactive identification of high-risk customers  
- Improved customer lifetime value through targeted retention strategies  
- Supported higher free-to-premium conversion rates  
- Optimized marketing and retention spend using churn predictions
